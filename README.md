<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

Source code use is intended for Linux users only. OpenCV and Dlib are available for Windows and Mac as well, but it has
not been tested yet.

Requirements:
* Linux machine: this section will provide installation details for both Debian-based and RPM-based systems, tested on
Ubuntu 18.04 and Fedora 29
* Laptop with a built-in web camera
* Python 3.x, tested on Python 3.7.1

<h3>Installation of OpenCV and Dlib</h3>

We can use ```pip``` to install OpenCV. In case of errors, you might have to install from source. For that, look at
[this section](#bfs-opencv). There are four different packages, and you must select <b>only one</b> of them. This is a
set of unofficial pre-built OpenCV packages. Check <a href="https://docs.opencv.org/master/">here</a> for official
documentation.

* For standard desktop environments:
    * ```pip3 install opencv-python``` if main modules are needed.
    * ```pip3 install opencv-contrib-python``` if main and ```contrib``` modules are needed
* For headless environments (no GUI, beloved CLI only)
    * ```pip3 install opencv-python-headless``` if main modules are needed
    * ```pip3 install opencv-contrib-python-headless``` if main and ```contrib``` modules are needed

<a name="bfs-opencv">If you will/want to build OpenCV from source</a>:
* For <a href="https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/05/28/ubuntu-18-04-how-to-install-opencv/">Debian-based</a> systems
* For <a href="https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/dd/dd5/tutorial_py_setup_in_fedora.html">RPM-based</a> systems


<h4>Debian-based systems</h4>

For Dlib, you need to install a few dependencies. Some of those might already be present on your system.

    $ sudo apt update
    $ sudo apt install build-essential cmake libopenblas-dev liblapack-dev libx11-dev libgtk-3-dev
                       python python-dev python-pip python3 python3-dev python3-pip

If you are running Python in a virtual environment (like you should be), then you can simply use

    $ pip3 install numpy
    $ pip3 install dlib

<h4>RPM-based systems</h4>

First, <a href="http://dlib.net/compile.html">download and extract latest version of Dlib</a> in your home folder. Next,
you will probably need to install the following:

    $ sudo dnf install cmake gcc-c++

Move to the extracted folder and run

    $ cd examples
    $ mkdir build && cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ cmake --build . --config Release

Installation of ```face_recognition``` is common for both types and can be accomplished with ```pip```
package manager.

    $ pip3 install face_recognition

<h1>Use</h1>

In order to run the ```RecognitionPrototype.py```, you need to populate folder ```faceData``` with headshots of yourself
and/or those you wish to use in the recognition program. This script is written to find a match with a single image, because
it is a prototype.

You should name your photos according to the following convention:

    your-name001.jpg
    your-name002.jpg
    ...

Run script

    $ python3 RecognitionPrototype.py
