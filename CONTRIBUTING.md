## <a name="coc"></a> Code of Conduct

Maintainers and contributors of ProjectFaceRecognition have a goal of cooperating
on a shared project. In order to ensure healthy environment for everyone, the
minimum necessary standards are:

* Respect: anyone willing to contribute, regardless of their technical knowledge,
must be respectful, inclusive and tolerable towards others. No trolling or
flaming is allowed. Each contributor must be responsible in their work.
* Legality: criminal solicitation is strictly prohibited. Due to nature of the
project, it is critical that nobody is willing to initiate an incentive to use
any part of the source code for malicious intents.
* Technical correctness: strive for accuracy, completeness and correctness. This
is especially important for translators. Your technical documentation needs to
include proper terminology. Adhere to the following standards:
  * Avoid controversial topics like religion, sport, race, nationalism and politics
  * Ineffective discussions are not productive
* Freedom: this is an open-source project, and as such you have the absolute
freedom when it comes to forking the project and developing it for your personal
intentions. However, read license!

## <a name="qap"></a> Questions and Problems

Do not open issues for general questions, as Github issues are intended for bugs
reports and feature requests.

Since majority of our work consists in Python, general programming questions are
better asked on Stack Overflow or similar sites.

## <a name="iab"></a> Issues and Bugs

If you suspect a bug, please submit an issue. If you have a solution for a problem,
please submit a pull request.

## <a name="submission"></a> Submission guidelines

When you are submitting an issue, it is important to provide the following details:
* Equipment you are using
* Version of Python
* Use case that caused an issue
Without those details, it is sometimes impossible to replicate the scenario when
the issue occurred.

If you are submitting a pull request (PR), then
* Search for open or closed PR that relate to the problem.
* Issue must describe the problem you are solving. In case of features, please
provide some sort of documentation that can help us ensure your work will be
beneficial to the project.
* Fork the repository
* Make changes in a new git branch!
* Follow Coding Rules
* Commit changes according to Commit Message Guidelines
* Push your branch to GitHub

If your pull request is merged
* Delete the remote branch on Github
* Check out the master branch
* Delete the local branch
* Update the master with the latest upstream version
